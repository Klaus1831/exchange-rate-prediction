# Exchange Rate Prediction Project

Goal: This project is one of the series built and developed with the aim of improving Data Science skillsets, both technical and analytical. 

Context: I'm not formally trained or with higher degree in data science and this is all self-learning, so feedback is greatly appreciated!

Agenda:

Part 1: Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Visualisation (Bonus: Hypothesis Testing)

Part 2: Machine Learning with 5 Regression Models

Part 3: Machine Learning (cont.) with ARIMA
